# üì¶ logistic-dapp-contracts

A project for CSC4312 Blockchain and Application course.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction

The project that we are building is inspired by the complex ecosystem of logistic chain ‚Äì where different companies which handle different aspects of the chain harmonize together to complete the shipment of goods. For example, a courier company which only specializes in ground shipment might have to forward their goods to a company that specializes in sea or air freight. As such, it is important for every party participating in the logistic chain to be able to integrate with one another efficiently.

In order to simulate the bidirectional relationship of differing parties in the chain, we will be taking advantage of the compossibility that Ethereum smart contracts offer. Compossibility allows a contract to interact and be integrated with other contracts in the blockchain, meaning, a system or application can be developed on top of an ecosystem of interrelated contracts.

Therefore, for this project we have built 2 contracts to simulate both a courier company - specializes in delivering goods directly to a person (e.g., Poslaju, GD Express) ‚Äì and a container company ‚Äì specializes in delivering containers from one port to another (e.g., Maersk, Evergreen). The contracts will conveniently be called CourierCompany and ContainerCompany respectively.
